              <ul>
                <li>In-game currency: Jet Pack tokens can be utilized as in-game currency for various games and apps
                  built on the platform.
                </li>
                <li>Atomic swap fees: Jet Pack tokens can be used to pay fees when swapping NFTs through the atomic
                  swap feature. The fees collected will be burned permanently, reducing the overall supply of Jet Pack
                  tokens.

            <div className="content">
              <ul>
                <li>Smart contract audit: Jet Pack's smart contract will undergo a thorough audit by a reputable third
                  party to ensure its security and functionality.
                </li>
                <li>Consensus-based decision-making: As Cardano currently does not officially support multi-signature
                  wallets, the project will implement a consensus-based decision-making process for token distribution
                  and budget execution. This involves collaborating with project participants and reaching an
                  agreement before conducting any major transactions.
                </li>
                <li>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Utilize a DAO structure with community involvement
                  for token management, further promoting transparency and trust within the project.
                </li>
                <li>Regular reporting: The project team will provide regular updates to the community, detailing the
                  progress of the project and the allocation of funds.

              <ul>
                <li>Jet Pack Platform: The project aims to develop a platform where developers can create games and
                  apps that utilize Jet Pack tokens as in-game currency. This will help expand the Jet Pack ecosystem
                  and increase the token's utility.
                </li>
                <li>Partnerships and collaborations: Jet Pack will actively seek partnerships and collaborations with
                  other projects, further expanding the token's utility and value.
                </li>
                <li>Community engagement: Jet Pack will continue to engage with the community, collecting feedback and

            <div className="content">
              Until multi-signature wallets are officially supported by Cardano, the Jet Pack team will implement a
              consensus-based decision-making process for token distribution and budget execution.
              For example, a Discord-based operational organization will be created where a group of individuals can
              reach a consensus and operate the project through multi-signature transactions.
              This will promote transparency and trust within the project and ensure that major transactions are
              conducted with the agreement of the group.
              As the Cardano ecosystem continues to develop, the Jet Pack team will closely monitor developments and
              adapt accordingly.
